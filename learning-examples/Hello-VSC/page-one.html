    <h1>Paul Rennison's Website</h1> 
    <p>I need to learn some basic HTML. I will do this by creating this website, the Title above is a h1 heading</p>

    <h2>About Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of the site. There are 6 levels of heading from h1-h6, the title of this section is a h2 heading can you see the difference from the h1 heading above ?</p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>This is how you create an un-ordered list:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Add a "ul" element (ul = unordered list li = list item)</li>
        <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
        <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
        <li><p>HTML has strict rules about what elements can go inside other elements. If you are ever unsure do a quick google search for "MDN "< some-element >"". 
            This line is a paragraph element nested in a list element</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like (it is a numbered list)</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Notice the new "ol" (ordered list) element wrapping everything</li>
        <li>But the list item elements are the same (li)</li>
        <li>Also note how the numbers increment on there own</li>
        <li>You should be noticing the list is in a precise order, because after all this is an ordered list</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase, This can be doe with an inline element like "< em>< /em >"</p>
    <p>Other times you need to <strong>Strongly</strong> emphasize the importance of a word or phrase. To do this use the "< strong >" element</p>
    <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>
    <p>this can be done by nesting a < strong > element in an < em > element or visa-versa</p>

    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>


    <p>Thank you for reading! I am getting better at HTML now, Empty elements do not have a closing tag, in the below paragraph element it includes a < br/> element to give a hard line break after Regards</p>


    <p>Regards,<br/>

    <p>P.S This page might look just like text, but i'll fix that with some CSS soon.
        We Can add a Horizontal Rule (the line above) by using the < hr/ > element
